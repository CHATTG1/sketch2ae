# [AEUX](https://aeux.io/)
With a name and complete rewrite of Sketch2AE, AEUX is faster and stronger than ever.
[Sketch][66b609ab] layers (and soon [Figma](https://figma.com)) may easily be transferred to [After Effects][56a59ddd] as shape layers, but with support for modern Sketch features like symbol overrides, reduced reliance on images (gradients yay), greater accuracy on text layers, nested precomps on groups, and it's about 90% faster.

Still in beta while working on the Figma converter.

> This is not an official Google product. Motion designers at Google just kinda like it a lot. Built by [Adam Plouff][8638464d].
